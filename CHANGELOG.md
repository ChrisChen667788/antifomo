# Changelog

## 0.3.0+20260423 - 2026-04-23

- Stabilized the compare/export delivery chain with version diff recap, evidence appendix, Markdown/PDF/Exec Brief exports, archive recap exports, and section-level diagnostics.
- Added persistent `compare_snapshot.metadata_payload` with SQLite compatibility backfill, frozen offline-evaluation snapshots, and legacy snapshot backfill disclosure in the compare UI and exports.
- Added offline research evaluation metrics for retrieval hit rate, target-account support rate, and section evidence quota pass rate.
- Strengthened research quality gates around canonical organization linking, official-source support, guarded backlog handling, and low-quality report rewrite/backfill.
- Added the first RAG quality-engineering baseline: hybrid retrieval tests, knowledge retrieval previews, and report-level evidence chunk retrieval.
- Fixed the antifomo Web port baseline to `3010` and refreshed the local start/stop scripts around the dedicated port.
